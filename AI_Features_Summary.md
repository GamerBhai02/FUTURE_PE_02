# AI Features Summary – Task 2

## 1. AI-Generated Website Content
The website content, including product descriptions, feature explanations, and section headings, was created using AI-assisted content generation tools to ensure clarity, consistency, and marketing relevance.

## 2. AI-Based Chatbot Support
An AI-powered chatbot was integrated using Tidio (Lyra AI Agent – Free Plan).
The chatbot assists users by:
- Answering product-related questions
- Explaining features and use cases
- Guiding users through the website

This improves user engagement and simulates real-world AI-powered customer support.

## 3. Automated Contact Form
A contact form was integrated using Google Forms.
User submissions are automatically captured and stored, enabling efficient lead collection.
This demonstrates basic automation and real-world form handling without custom backend code.
